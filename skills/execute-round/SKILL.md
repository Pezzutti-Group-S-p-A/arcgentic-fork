name: execute-round
description: Use when a planned round handoff exists and needs to be implemented end-to-end via the 4-commit chain (entry-admin → BA design → dev body with inline CR + SE → state refresh + self-audit). Dispatches ba-designer / developer / cr-reviewer / se-contract sequentially.

# execute-round

Orchestrates the 4-commit chain for an arcgentic round per spec § 4.2.3. Reads the planned
handoff (from `plan-round` skill or hand-authored), then executes Phase 1-4 via the
`arcgentic` Python CLI.

## When to invoke

- User says "let's execute round R{N}" or "run the 4-commit chain for the handoff at ..."
- User runs `/execute-round <round_name>` slash command
- A handoff doc exists at `docs/superpowers/plans/...` and dev work is ready to start

## Prerequisites

Requires the `arcgentic` CLI:
- Stable (this fork, includes the ocr pre-filter patch): `pipx install "git+https://github.com/Pezzutti-Group-S-p-A/arcgentic-fork.git#subdirectory=toolkit"`
- Dev: `cd toolkit && pip install -e ".[dev]"`

The ocr pre-filter on the inline CR step is **on by default** in this
skill's own invocation below (`ARCGENTIC_OCR_PREFILTER=1`, delegate mode —
no API key needed). If `ocr` is not installed, or fails, the CLI degrades
to a warning and runs the round exactly as without it — nothing to set up
to get this skill working, and nothing breaks if `ocr` is missing. See
README.md § "ocr pre-filter" for install and the review-mode alternative
(needs a provider + API key, e.g. for Gemini). To skip it for one
invocation, drop the `ARCGENTIC_OCR_PREFILTER=1` prefix from the command in
Workflow step 2 below.

Requires a planned handoff doc — run `/plan-round` first if missing.

V1 projects must resolve the session-mode gate before implementation. If
`project.session_mode.mode` is already present in `.agentic-rounds/state.yaml`,
use it and do not ask again:

```bash
arcgentic session-mode recommend --round=$ROUND --handoff=$HANDOFF_PATH
arcgentic session-mode prompt --round=$ROUND --handoff=$HANDOFF_PATH --mode=multi-session --role=developer
```

## Inputs

Parse from `$ARGUMENTS`:
- `round_name` (e.g. "R10-L3-aletheia")
- `handoff_path` (defaults to most recent `docs/superpowers/plans/{date}-{round}-handoff.md`)
- `--dry-run` flag (optional; skip all commits and pushes)

## Workflow

When invoked:

1. Verify the handoff doc exists at `handoff_path`.
2. Shell out (ocr pre-filter on by default — delegate mode, no API key):
   ```
   ARCGENTIC_OCR_PREFILTER=1 arcgentic execute-round-impl --round=$ROUND --handoff=$HANDOFF_PATH [--dry-run]
   ```
3. The CLI orchestrates 4 phases:
   - **Phase 1 — Entry-admin commit**: commit handoff + state-row updates
   - **Phase 2 — BA design pass**: dispatch ba-designer → write design doc → commit
   - **Phase 3 — Dev body**: dispatch developer → run pre-audit quality gates (mypy / pytest / ruff) → inline CR step → inline SE step (MANDATE #20: NO BA design in SE brief) → commit
   - **Phase 4 — State refresh + self-audit handoff**: compose self-audit handoff doc with stable artifact/fixed-anchor facts → run `arcgentic audit-check --strict-extended` → write → commit

4. Read CLI output for result summary (per ExecuteRoundResult.summary()):
   - 4 phase results with commit SHAs
   - CR + SE findings counts
   - Quality gate statuses
   - Self-audit handoff path

5. Report to user: 4 commit SHAs + findings counts + handoff path.

## Known limitations (forward-debts)

- **ER-RETRY**: no retry-with-context loops; if any sub-agent dispatch fails, the run aborts. Re-invoke after fixing the failure manually.
- **ER-AUDIT-FACTS-RICH**: self-audit facts avoid mutable current-state / moving-HEAD assertions, but rich commit-chain / changed-file fact generation is future work.
- **ER-STATE-ROW**: Phase 1's CLAUDE.md state-row update is a NO-OP (project-agnostic).

See `docs/tech-debt.md` for the full forward-debt registry.

## Failure modes

- **Missing handoff doc**: re-run `/plan-round` first.
- **CLI not installed**: instruct user to `pipx install arcgentic`.
- **Sub-agent dispatch failure**: re-invoke after fixing (no automatic retry in v0.2.0 P0).
- **Quality gate FAIL**: developer output had errors; review BA design + fix dev output manually; re-invoke.
